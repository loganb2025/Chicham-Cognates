# Chicham-Cognates
I am an MA student at the University of New Mexico and this is my final project for my Data Science course. In this project I aim to use the Liepzig-Jakarta concept list to compare cognates across the four Chicham Languages.



Below is my change log which also contains my decision process on certian cognates

changes across the data	
  When a concept covers two separate things (like arm/hand) I checked both dictionary entries and if the words are different I gave each an entry	
  If a concept has several words in the target language (this happened often with shuar) I will enter them all to judge cognacy later	
	
changes after collection	
5-May	made a new sheet to make first cognate judgements, this is where I began seperating the various terms in the target language accoridng to cognacy
	first cognacy judgements were made based on form, more complex judgements will be made after (such as judgements which will take more analysis of the phonotactics of the languages)
	these initial cognates were "are these the exact same word judgements" if they were not then they were marked to come back to later
	some sound correspondences were also very easy to trace so these are included in the first pass
	for the entry 'fly' I initially included the verb and noun in my very first coding of the first source but by the second source I decided to only include the noun as the leipzig-jakarta list specifies when the concept is a noun so I deleted 'fly (verb)' in the first pass of cognates
7-May	Begin assessing second pass cognates, when languages have multiple words for one concept I have split them. If one is cognate I will keep that and delete the rest. If none are cognate I will delete none
	These deletions are marked in notes but they will actually be deleted in pass 3
	HAND and ARM need to be rearranged
	ended at concept 51
	added concepticon IDs
8-May	I added cognates for concepts 51-80 and finished concepticon IDs
9-May	I finished cognate judgements and created third-cognates. Here i deleted all DELETE rows, i will need to reassess some cognates
	Deleted page number column
9-May	I need to reassess some cognates and finalize pass 3
	BIG2 could be also cogate with BIG1 but sound correspondence is listed.
12-May	The hit/beat cognate set was assesed as havig no cognates due to inconsistent sound correspondences but this could be reassesed
	hub and jiv words for 'come' could be assessed as cognate but the sound correspondences are inconsistent
	the jiv word for child is assessed as NOT cognate due to the change in form
	the entire set for the concept BURN is assessed as not cogate similarly to HIT/BEAT
	KNOW cognate set reassessed as 2 cognate sets not 1
	the concept set for EAT has been assessed as not cognate due to too many inconsistent soudn correspondences, this could be reassessed
	the set for FALL has also been assessed as not cognate
	i added a phoneme inventory sheet that comapares the phoneme inventories of the 4 languages
